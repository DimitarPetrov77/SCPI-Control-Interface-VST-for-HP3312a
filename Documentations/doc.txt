SYNC Signal
A sync signal output is provided on the front-panel SYNC terminal. 
All of the standard output functions (except dc and noise) have an
associated sync signal. For certain applications where you may not want
to output the sync signal, you can disable the SYNC terminal.
The SYNC terminal can be enabled/disabled from the remote interface only.
 By default, the sync signal is routed to the SYNC terminal (enabled).
 When the sync signal is disabled, the output level on the SYNC
terminal is indeterminate (it might be a TTL “high” or a TTL “low”).
 For sine, square, triangle, and ramp waveforms, the sync signal is a
TTL “high” when the waveform’s output is positive, relative to zero
volts (or the dc offset value). The signal is a TTL “low” when the
output is negative, relative to zero volts (or the dc offset value). 
 For arbitrary waveforms, a momentary TTL “high” pulse (> 200 ns) is
output which corresponds to the first downloaded point in the waveform.
 For AM and FM, the sync signal is referenced to the modulating
signal (not the carrier). A momentary TTL “high” pulse (> 200 ns) is
output at each zero-crossing point of the modulating signal.
 For the triggered burst mode, a TTL “low” signal is output while the
specified number of cycles is output (for the duration of the burst).
After the specified number of cycles has been output, the sync signal
goes “high” until the next burst. 
 For the external gated burst mode, the sync signal is a TTL “high”
when the output is positive, relative to zero volts (or the dc offset
value). The signal is a TTL “low” when the output is negative, relative
to zero volts (or the dc offset value). 
 For FSK, a momentary TTL “high” pulse (> 200 ns) is output on the
transition to the “hop” frequency.
 For frequency sweeps, the sync signal is a TTL “low” at the start of the
sweep (when the start frequency is output) and is a TTL “high” at the
end of the sweep (when the stop frequency is output).

Instrument State Storage
You can store up to three different instrument states in non-volatile
memory. This enables you to recall the entire instrument configuration
with a single command from the remote interface or with just a few
key presses from the front panel. 
 Three memory locations (numbered 1, 2, and 3) are available to store
instrument configurations. The state storage feature “remembers” the
function (including arbitrary waveforms), frequency, amplitude,
dc offset, duty cycle, as well as any modulation parameters. To recall
a stored state, you must use the same memory location used
previously to store the state.
 You cannot recall the instrument state from a memory location that
was not previously specified as a storage location. For example, an
error is generated if you attempt to recall from memory location “2”
but have never stored to that location.
From the front panel, “NOT STORED” is displayed if nothing is stored
in the specified memory location. From the remote interface, a
+810, “State has not been stored” error is generated if nothing is
stored in the specified memory location.
 Any arbitrary waveforms downloaded to “VOLATILE” memory are not
remembered. However, if an arbitrary waveform is being output
from non-volatile memory when the state is stored, the waveform
data is stored. The stored waveform is output when the instrument
state is recalled.
 If you delete an arbitrary waveform after storing the state, the
waveform data is lost and the function generator will not output the
waveform when the state is recalled. The “SINC” waveform is output
in place of the deleted waveform.

 When power is turned off, the function generator automatically stores
its state in memory location “0”. You can configure the function
generator to automatically recall the power-down state when power is
restored. The recall mode is disabled when the function generator is
shipped from the factory.
Select the POWER ON LAST STATE command from the SYS MENU to
enable the power-down recall mode. Select POWER ON DEFAULT to
disable the power-down recall mode. See “Power-Down Recall Mode”
on page 109 for more information. 
 From the remote interface, you can use memory location “0” to store
a fourth instrument configuration (you cannot store to this memory
location from the front panel). However, keep in mind that memory
location “0” is automatically overwritten when the power is turned off.
 Front-Panel Operation: 
To store the state, press Shift Store . Then use the knob, arrow
keys, or “Enter Number” mode to select the memory location. 
To restore the state, press Recall . Then use the knob, arrow keys,

 *SAV {0|1|2|3} State 0 is the instrument state at power down.
 *RCL {0|1|2|3} States 1, 2, and 3 are user-defined states.

and clear the memory location. If nothing is stored in the specified

Amplitude Modulation (AM) 
A modulated waveform consists of a carrier waveform and a modulating
waveform. In AM, the amplitude of the carrier is varied by the amplitude
of the modulating waveform. The function generator will accept an
internal modulating signal, an external modulating signal, or both. 
For more information on the fundamentals of Amplitude Modulation,
refer to chapter 7, “Tutorial”.

Burst Modulation
You can configure the function generator to output a waveform with a
specified number of cycles, called a burst. You can output the burst at a
rate determined by the internal rate generator or an external signal
applied to the rear-panel connector. The function generator can produce
a burst using sine, square, triangle, ramp, and arbitrary waveforms.
For more information on the fundamentals of Burst Modulation,
refer to chapter 7, “Tutorial”. 
You can use burst modulation in the following two modes. The function
generator enables one burst mode at a time based on the trigger source
and burst source that you select (see the table below).
 Triggered Burst Mode: In this mode, the function generator outputs
a waveform with a specified number of cycles (burst count) each time
a trigger is received. After the specified number of cycles has been
output, the function generator waits for the next trigger. You can
configure the function generator to accept an internal trigger or you
can send the trigger externally by pressing the front-panel Single key
or by applying a trigger signal to the rear-panel Ext Trig terminal.
At power-on, the internally-triggered burst mode is enabled.
 External Gated Burst Mode: In this mode, the output waveform is
either “on” or “off ” based on the level of the external signal applied to
the rear-panel Ext Trig terminal. When the gate signal is true,
the function generator outputs a continuous waveform. When the
gate signal is false, the output is turned off.

Burst Trigger Source
In the triggered burst mode, the function generator outputs a waveform
with the specified number of cycles (burst count) each time a trigger is
received. After the specified number of cycles has been output, the
function generator waits for the next trigger while outputting no signal
(zero volts or the dc offset level). At power-on, the internally-triggered
burst mode is enabled.
 Trigger source: Internal, Single, or External. The default is Internal.
 In the triggered burst mode, the “burst source” is Internal.
 When the internal trigger source is selected, the frequency at which
the burst is generated is determined by the burst rate parameter.
The burst rate frequency defines the interval between bursts. 
 Pressing Single to enable the single trigger mode also enables the
external trigger mode. External triggering is like the front-panel
single trigger mode except that you apply a trigger signal to the
rear-panel Ext Trig terminal. The function generator is triggered on
the rising edge of a TTL pulse.
 The Trig annunciator turns on when the function generator is waiting
for a single or external trigger.
 When the single or external trigger source is selected, the burst count
and burst phase remain in effect but the burst rate is ignored. 
 When the external gate source is selected (“gated” burst mode), the
specified trigger source is ignored. The external gated mode overrides

 When the external gate source is selected, the output is enabled or

Burst Carrier Frequency
The carrier frequency defines the repetition rate of the burst waveform
in the triggered and external gated modes. In the triggered mode, the
number of cycles specified by the burst count are output at the frequency
of the carrier signal. In the external gated mode, the carrier frequency is
output when the external gate signal is true (TTL high).
Keep in mind that the carrier frequency is different than the “burst rate”
which specifies the interval between bursts (triggered mode only).
 Carrier frequency: 10 mHz to 5 MHz (100 kHz for triangle and ramp).
The default is 1 kHz. You can use sine, square, ramp, triangle, or
arbitrary waveforms for the carrier waveshape.
 Be sure to note the restrictions for carrier frequency and
burst count shown on the following pages.

Burst Count
The burst count defines the number of cycles to be output per burst.
Used only in the triggered burst mode (internal or external source).
Certain combinations of burst count and carrier frequency are not 
allowed. If you attempt to specify a burst count that is not valid, 
the function generator will automatically adjust the count to 
the maximum value allowed with the present carrier frequency. 
Make sure you note the restrictions in “Burst Carrier Frequency” starting
on page 85 before setting the burst count. 
 Burst count: 1 to 50,000 cycles, in 1 cycle increments. You can also
select an infinite burst count. The default is 1 cycle.
 When the internal trigger source is selected, the specified number of
cycles is output continuously at a rate determined by the burst rate
setting. The burst rate frequency defines the interval between bursts. 
 When the single or external trigger source is selected, the burst count

Burst Rate
The burst rate defines the frequency at which internally triggered bursts

Keep in mind that the burst rate is different than the “carrier frequency”
which specifies the frequency of the bursted signal. 
 Burst rate: 10 mHz to 50 kHz. The default is 100 Hz.
 The burst rate setting is used only when internal triggering is
enabled (triggered mode). The burst rate is ignored when single
triggering or external triggering is enabled.

 When the external gate burst source is selected (“gated” burst mode),
the burst count, burst rate, burst phase, and burst trigger source are
ignored (these parameters are used for the triggered burst mode only).
 It is possible to specify a burst rate which is too fast for the function
generator to output with the specified carrier frequency and burst
count. If the burst rate is too high, the function generator will
internally adjust it as needed to continuously re-trigger the burst.
The adjustment is handled internally by the function generator
(the burst rate displayed or queried will be the same as specified).

 Burst phase: -360 degrees to +360 degrees, in 0.001 degree increments.
The default is 0 degrees.
 For sine, square, triangle, and ramp waveforms, 0 degrees is the point
at which the waveform crosses zero volts (or the dc offset value), in a
positive-going direction. 
 For arbitrary waveforms, 0 degrees is the first data point downloaded
to memory.
 When the external gate source is selected (“gated” burst mode),
the burst count, burst rate, burst phase, and burst trigger source are
ignored (these parameters are used for the triggered burst mode only).

Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK) Modulation
You can configure the function generator to “shift” its output frequency
between two preset values using FSK modulation. The rate at which the
output shifts between the two frequencies (called the “carrier frequency”
and the “hop frequency”) is determined by the internal rate generator or
the signal level on the rear-panel FSK terminal. The function generator
can produce an FSK waveform using sine, square, triangle, ramp, and
arbitrary waveforms.
For more information on the fundamentals of FSK Modulation,
refer to chapter 7, “Tutorial”. 
To Select FSK Modulation
 The FSK annunciator turns on when FSK is enabled.
 Only one modulation mode can be enabled at a time. When you
enable FSK, the previous modulation mode is turned off. 
 Front-Panel Operation: Enable FSK before you set up the other
modulation parameters. Press Shift FSK to output the waveform
using the present settings for frequency, amplitude, and offset voltage.
 Remote Interface Operation: To ensure proper operation, you should
enable FSK after you have set up the other modulation parameters.

FSK Carrier Frequency 
 Carrier frequency: 10 mHz to 15 MHz (100 kHz for triangle
and ramp). The default is 1 kHz. You can use sine, square, ramp,
triangle, or arbitrary waveforms for the carrier waveform.
 For arbitrary waveforms, the maximum carrier frequency depends on
the number of points specified in the waveform. The five built-in
arbitrary waveforms can be output at a maximum of 5 MHz. 
 
 For an externally-controlled FSK waveform, the carrier frequency is
output when a “low” TTL level is applied to the FSK terminal. The hop
frequency is output when a “high” TTL level is applied.
 For FSK, the sync signal is referenced to the FSK “hop” signal (not the
carrier). A momentary TTL “high” pulse (> 200 ns) is output on the
transition to the “hop” frequency. The signal is output from the frontpanel SYNC terminal. 
 Front-Panel Operation: Press the Freq key and select any valid
frequency for the selected function (the present amplitude and offset
voltage are used). 
 Remote Interface Operation:

 For arbitrary waveforms, the maximum hop frequency depends on
the number of points specified in the waveform. The five built-in

Frequency Sweep 
In the frequency sweep mode, the function generator “steps” from the
start frequency to the stop frequency at a sweep rate which you specify.
You can sweep up or down in frequency, and with either linear or
logarithmic spacing. You can also configure the function generator to
output a single sweep (one pass from start frequency to stop frequency)
by applying an external trigger. The function generator can produce a
frequency sweep for sine, square, triangle, ramp, or arbitrary waveforms.
For more information on the fundamentals of frequency sweeps, refer to
chapter 7, “Tutorial”. 
To Select Sweep Modulation
 The Swp annunciator turns on when the sweep mode is enabled. 
 Only one modulation mode can be enabled at a time. When you
enable the sweep mode, the previous modulation mode is turned off. 
 Front-Panel Operation: Enable the sweep mode before you set up the
other sweep parameters. Press Shift Sweep to output a sweep using
the present settings for amplitude and offset voltage.
 Remote Interface Operation: To ensure proper operation, you should
enable the sweep mode after you have set up the other modulation
parameters.

Start Frequency and Stop Frequency
The start frequency and stop frequency set the upper and lower
frequency bounds for the sweep. The function generator begins at the
start frequency, sweeps to the stop frequency, and then resets back to
the start frequency.
 Start and Stop frequencies: 10 mHz to 15 MHz (100 kHz for triangle
and ramp). The sweep is phase continuous over the full frequency
range. The default start frequency is 100 Hz. The default stop
frequency is 1 kHz. The *RST command sets the start frequency to
10 mHz (minimum) and the stop frequency to 15 MHz (maximum). 
 For arbitrary waveforms, the maximum start or stop frequency
depends on the number of points specified in the waveform. The five
built-in arbitrary waveforms can be output at a maximum of 5 MHz. 
 
 To sweep up in frequency, set the start frequency < stop frequency.
To sweep down in frequency, set the start frequency > stop frequency.
 The sync signal is a TTL “low” at the start of the sweep (when the
start frequency is output) and is a TTL “high” at the end of the sweep
(when the stop frequency is output). The signal is output from the
front-panel SYNC terminal.

Sweep Trigger Source
In the triggered sweep mode, the function generator outputs a single
sweep each time a trigger is received. After one sweep from the start
frequency to the stop frequency, the function generator waits for the
next trigger while outputting the start frequency.
 Sweep trigger source: Internal, Single, or External. The default
is Internal. 
 When the internal trigger source is enabled (default), the function
generator outputs a continuous sweep at a rate determined by the
sweep rate specified. 
 Pressing Single to enable the single trigger mode also enables the
external trigger mode. External triggering is like the front-panel
single trigger mode except that you apply a trigger signal to the
rear-panel Ext Trig terminal. The function generator is triggered on
the rising edge of a TTL pulse.
 The Trig annunciator turns on when the function generator is waiting
for a single or external trigger.

 Internal or “automatic” triggering is enabled when you turn on the
function generator. In this mode, the function generator outputs
continuously when the burst mode or sweep mode is selected. 
 Single triggering outputs one burst or initiates one sweep each time
you press Single from the front-panel. Continue pressing this key to
re-trigger the function generator. 
 Pressing Single to enable the single trigger mode also enables the
external trigger mode. External triggering is like the front-panel
single trigger mode except that you apply a trigger signal to the
rear-panel Ext Trig terminal. The function generator is triggered on

Trigger Source Choices 
Applies only to burst and sweep. You must specify the source from which
the function generator will accept a trigger. 
 From the front panel, the function generator will accept a single
trigger, a hardware trigger from the Ext Trig terminal, or
continuously output bursts or sweeps using the internal trigger.
At power-on, internal trigger is selected. 
 From the remote interface, the function generator will accept
a software (bus) trigger, a hardware trigger from the Ext Trig
terminal, or an immediate internal trigger.
 The trigger source setting is stored in volatile memory; the source is
set to internal trigger (front panel) or immediate (remote interface)
when power has been off or after a remote interface reset.
 To select the trigger source from the remote interface, use the
following command. The APPLy command automatically sets the
trigger source to IMMediate .
 TRIGger:SOURce {IMMediate|EXTernal|BUS}
Internal Triggering In this trigger mode, the function generator
continuously outputs the burst or sweep (as specified by the burst rate
or sweep time). This is the power-on trigger source for both front-panel
and remote interface use. 
To select the internal trigger source from the remote interface, use the
following command. The APPLy command automatically sets the

annunciator turns on when the function generator is waiting for
a single trigger.
The front-panel Single key is disabled when in remote.
External Triggering In this trigger mode, the function generator will
accept a hardware trigger applied to the Ext Trig terminal. The function
generator outputs one burst or initiates one sweep each time Ext Trig
receives the rising edge of a TTL pulse.
See also “Ext Trig/FSK/Burst Input Terminal,” on page 102.
 Front-Panel Operation: The external trigger mode is like the single
trigger mode except that you apply the trigger to the Ext Trig

 Triggered Sweep Mode: Press Single or execute TRIG:SOUR EXT
from the remote interface to enable the triggered sweep mode
(sweeps must be enabled). When the rising edge of a TTL pulse is
received on the Ext Trig terminal, the function generator outputs a
single sweep. The Trig annunciator turns on when the function
generator is waiting for a trigger.
 Externally-Modulated FSK Mode: To enable the externallymodulated mode, select “FSK SRC EXT” from the front-panel MOD
MENU or execute FSK:SOUR EXT from the remote interface when
FSK is enabled. When a low TTL level is present, the FSK carrier
frequency is output. When a high TTL level is present, the FSK “hop”
frequency is output. The Ext annunciator turns on when selected.
 Triggered Burst Mode: Press Single or execute TRIG:SOUR EXT
from the remote interface to enable the triggered burst mode
(burst must be enabled). When the rising edge of a TTL pulse is
received, the function generator outputs a burst waveform with the
specified number of cycles. The Trig annunciator turns on when the
function generator is waiting for a trigger.
 External Gated Burst Mode: To enable the external gated mode,
select “BURST SRC EXT GATED” from the front-panel MOD MENU
or execute BM:SOUR EXT from the remote interface when burst is

System-Related Operations 
This section gives information on topics such as power-down recall,
self-test, error conditions, and front-panel display control. This
information is not directly related to waveform generation but is an
important part of operating the function generator.
Power-Down Recall Mode
When power is turned off, the function generator automatically stores
its state in memory location “0”. You can configure the function
generator to automatically recall the power-down state when power is
restored. The recall mode is disabled when the function generator is
shipped from the factory. 
The power-down recall mode can be set from the front-panel only.
 When the recall mode is disabled (factory setting), the function
generator powers up in its default configuration (see page 123).
When the recall mode is enabled, the function generator powers up
in the power-down configuration. 
 The power-down recall setting is stored in non-volatile memory,
and does not change when power has been off or after a remote
interface reset. 
 The power-down recall mode “remembers” the function (including
arbitrary waveforms), frequency, amplitude, dc offset, duty cycle,
as well as any modulation parameters. 
 Any arbitrary waveforms downloaded to “VOLATILE” memory are not
remembered. However, if an arbitrary waveform is being output
from non-volatile memory when the state is stored, the waveform
data is stored. The stored waveform is output when the instrument
state is recalled.

Error Conditions 
When the front-panel ERROR annunciator turns on, one or more
command syntax or hardware errors have been detected. A record of
up to 20 errors can be stored in the function generator’s error queue. 
See chapter 5, “Error Messages,” for a complete listing of the errors.
 Errors are retrieved in first-in-first-out (FIFO) order. The first error
returned is the first error that was stored. When you have read all
errors from the queue, the ERROR annunciator turns off. The function
generator beeps once each time an error is generated.
 If more than 20 errors have occurred, the last error stored in the
queue (the most recent error) is replaced with -350, “Too many errors”.
No additional errors are stored until you remove errors from the
queue. If no errors have occurred when you read the error queue,
the function generator responds with +0, “No error”.
 The error queue is cleared when power has been off or after a *CLS
(clear status) command has been executed. The *RST (reset)
command does not clear the error queue. 
 Front-Panel Operation:

Self-Test 
 A power-on self-test occurs automatically when you turn on the
function generator. This limited test assures you that the function
generator is operational. 
 A complete self-test runs a series of tests and takes approximately
10 seconds to execute. If all tests pass, you can have a high confidence
that the function generator is fully operational.
 If the complete self-test is successful, “PASS” is displayed on the front
panel. If the self-test fails, “FAIL” is displayed and the ERROR
annunciator turns on. See the Service Guide for instructions on
returning the function generator to Agilent for service.
 Front-Panel Operation:

Another way to perform the complete self-test from the front panel
is as follows: Hold down Shift as you press the Power switch to turn
on the function generator; hold down the key for more than 5 seconds.
The self-test will begin when you release the key.
 Remote Interface Operation:

Returns “0” if the self-test passes or “1” if it fails. If the self-test fails,
an error message is also generated with additional information on
why the test failed.

Display Control 
To speed up the rate at which the function generator can make
configuration changes, or for security reasons, you may want to turn off
the front-panel display. From the remote interface, you can also display
a message containing up to 11 characters on the front panel.
The display can be enabled/disabled from the remote interface only.
 When the display is turned off, output parameters are not sent to the
display and all annunciators except ERROR and Shift are disabled.
Front-panel operation is otherwise unaffected by turning off the display.
 The display state is stored in volatile memory; the display is always
enabled when power has been off or after a remote interface reset. 
 You can display a message on the front panel by sending a command
from the remote interface. The function generator can display up to
11 characters of the message on the front panel; any additional
characters are truncated. Commas, periods, and semicolons share a
display space with the preceding character, and are not considered
individual characters. When a message is displayed, information
relating to the output waveform (such as frequency and amplitude)
is not sent to the display.
 Sending a message to the display from the remote interface overrides
the display state; this means that you can display a message even if
the display is turned off.
 The display state is automatically turned on when you return to the
local (front panel) state. Press the Shift key or execute LOCAL 710
from the remote interface to return to the local state.
 Remote Interface Operation: 
 DISPlay {OFF|ON} Disable/enable the display
 DISPlay:TEXT <quoted string> Display the string enclosed in quotes
 DISPlay:TEXT:CLEar Clear the displayed message
The following command string shows how to display a message on the
front panel.
 "DISP:TEXT ’HELLO’"

Comma Separators 
The function generator can display values on the front panel with or
without a comma separator. This feature is available only from the
front panel.
 15.000,000 MHz
 The display format is stored in non-volatile memory, and does not
change when power has been off or after a remote interface reset.
The comma separator is enabled when the function generator is
shipped from the factory.
 Front-Panel Operation: 
 5: COMMA (SYS MENU)
See also “To turn off the comma separator,” on page 52. 
Firmware Revision Query 
The function generator has three microprocessors for control of various
internal systems. You can query the function generator to determine
which revision of firmware is installed for each microprocessor.
 The function generator returns three numbers. The first number is
the firmware revision number for the main generator processor;
the second is for the input/output processor; and the third is for the
front-panel processor.
 Front-Panel Operation: 
 6: REVISION (SYS MENU)
 Remote Interface Operation:
 *IDN? Returns “HEWLETT-PACKARD,33120A,0,X.X-X.X-X.X”
Be sure to dimension a string variable with at least 40 characters.

Remote Interface Configuration 
This section gives information on configuring the remote interface.
For information on programming the function generator over the remote
interface, see chapter 4, “Remote Interface Reference,” starting on
page 125. 
GPIB Address 
Each device on the GPIB (IEEE-488) interface must have a unique
address. You can set the function generator’s address to any value
between 0 and 30. The current address is displayed momentarily on the
front panel when you turn on the function generator. The address is set to
“10” when the function generator is shipped from the factory. 
The GPIB address can be set from the front-panel only.
 The address is stored in non-volatile memory, and does not change
when power has been off or after a remote interface reset. 
 Your GPIB bus controller has its own address. Be sure to avoid using
the bus controller’s address for any instrument on the interface bus.
Agilent controllers generally use address “21”.
 Front-Panel Operation: 
 1: HPIB ADDR (I/O MENU)

Remote Interface Selection 
The function generator is shipped with both an GPIB (IEEE-488)
interface and an RS-232 interface. Only one interface can be enabled at
a time. The GPIB interface is selected when the function generator is
shipped from the factory.
The remote interface can be selected from the front-panel only.
 The interface selection is stored in non-volatile memory, and does not
change when power has been off or after a remote interface reset.
 If you select the GPIB interface, you must select a unique address for
the function generator. The current address is displayed momentarily
on the front panel when you turn on the function generator.
 Your GPIB bus controller has its own address. Be sure to avoid using
the bus controller’s address for any instrument on the interface bus. 
 If you enable the RS-232 interface, you must select the baud rate and
parity to be used. “RS-232” is displayed momentarily on the front
panel when you turn on the function generator if you have selected
this interface.
 Front-Panel Operation: 
 2: INTERFACE (I/O MENU)
See also “To select the remote interface,” on page 218.
Refer to “RS-232 Interface Configuration,” starting on page 195 for 
more information on connecting the function generator to a computer,
terminal, or modem over the RS-232 interface
